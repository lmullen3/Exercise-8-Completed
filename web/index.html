        <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite 
           holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
           Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
        
        <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween 
           pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep 
           you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

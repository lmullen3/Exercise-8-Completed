    <h1>The Halloween Store</h1>
    <h3>For the little Goblin in all of us</h3>
    <h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h2>
        <p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite 
           holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite
           Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
        <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween 
           pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep 
           you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

    <p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, 
        you can return it for a full refund. <b>No questions asked!</b></p>
